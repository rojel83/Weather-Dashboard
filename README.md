Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.


Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.


Your app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
Display the following under current weather conditions:
* City
* Date
* Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind speed
* UV index
  

Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.
Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:
* Date
* Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
